# Meta Tags: You've included meta tags for character set and viewport settings. This is good for ensuring proper rendering and responsiveness on different devices.

 # External Stylesheets: You've linked two external stylesheets - one for Bootstrap icons and the other for Font Awesome icons. Make sure you have internet connectivity or have downloaded these files locally for them to work.

# Form Element: There's a form element with an input field for searching a city, accompanied by a search icon.

 # Temperature Units: You've included temperature units (°C and °F) for users to toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit.

# Weather Information Display: The weather information is structured within various div elements. You have placeholders for city name, date and time, weather forecast, weather icon, temperature, and additional weather information.

# Weather Information Cards: There are cards displaying information like real feel, humidity, wind, and pressure. Icons from Bootstrap and Font Awesome are used for better visual representation.

# JavaScript File: You have a JavaScript file (main.js) linked with the type attribute set to "module". This suggests the use of ES6 modules in your JavaScript code.
# Initial Weather Fetch:
Overall, the code structure looks good.

Ensure that your fetchWeatherData and updateUI functions are correctly implemented in the referenced modules (api.js and ui.js).

Additionally, make sure that your HTML structure aligns with the selectors used in this JavaScript file.
